# Integration of Keras-Yolov3 with Home Assistant over MQTT.
This is an integration of object detection for the Home Asstant smart home platform. 
The integration is done over MQTT - images with detection boxes, motion event (with binary sensor) and TTS-text are sent over MQTT.

Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* Tensorflow + Keras installed (in your python environment)
* Keras-Yolov3 repository with my PR pulled in (or my local version at: https://github.com/joakimeriksson/keras-yolo3/tree/yolo3-boxes-api)
* OpenCV for python (pip3 install opencv-python)
* Camera (built in web camera or RTSP camera)
* MQTT broker
* A home assistant installation (if you want to test the integration)

I used the Anaconda python data science environment to get Keras and Tensorflow installed on my MAC but
there are multiple ways to install this.

# Getting started
To make a really quick test when you have the above installed.

1. Clone the keras-yolo3 and checkout the modified code (yolo3-boxes-api branch)

    > git clone https://github.com/joakimeriksson/keras-yolo3.git
    > cd keras-yolo3
    > git checkout yolo3-boxes-api

2. Clone this repository.

    > git clone https://github.com/joakimeriksson/ai-smarthome.git
    
    
3. Start the application

    > cd ai-smarthome/yolov3-ha
    > python smartcam.py -v 0 -s
    
 This should give you a video feed from "camera 0" on your computer. On My OS-X it is the webcam.
    
More documentation to come... including how to configure home assistant to receive the MQTT events.
